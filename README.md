# 242 - Final Project: Predicting whether a flight is delayed

For a Data Analysis class, my team and I had the idea to train Machine Learning models to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not. We found data about flights in the US that included destinations, the departing airport and informations about the flight itself. In our feature engineering phase, we added weather data according to departing and arriving airport. 

This project needed a lot of data engineering and data cleaning before we were able to actually train meodels.
